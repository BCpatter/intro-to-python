    "### Modern Physics Context for Q5-Q9\n",
    "\n",
    "For a long time, light was a challenging concept for physicists to understand. When you learned about optics, you mostly treated light as if it were a wave. Concepts such as inteference, diffraction, and polarization all demonstrate that light has a wave-like nature. However, when emission, absoption and scattering of light are looked at closely, physicsists found that light behaved more like a particle instead. A particuarly troubling observation to explain with the light-as-a-wave model was the **photoelectric effect.** The observation was this: incident light hits a surface and ejects electrons. \n",
    "\n",
    "While Einstein is most famous for his theory of general relativity, he won the Nobel prize for explaining the photoelectric effect. In order for those electrons to be ejected, they needed to absorbe enough energy to overcome the potential energy binding them to an atomic nucleus. There were several key pieces of evidence that went contrary to expectations were light just a wave. Two of these were:\n",
    "- The wave model would predict that the amount of electrons ejected should depend only on the intensity of light, not its frequency. But below a threshold frequency, *no* electrons were ejected.\n",
    "- The wave model predicts some time delay between when a light is turned on and when electrons are ejected. But no time delay was observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Einstein extended an idea developed by Max Planck that posited that light was made up of quantized packages of energy called **photons.** Each photon carries an energy given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E=hf=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h=6.62606896 \\times 10^{-34} \\, {Js}$ is Planck's constant, $f$ is the frequency of the light, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light. Recall that the wavelength and frequency of a wave are related to its speed, $v$, by $v=f \\lambda$. The speed of light is given by the constant $c=299,792 \\, {\\rm km/s}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is a bit strange that we are talking about the energy of a single photon, while still using equations that apply to waves ($c=f \\lambda$). Such is the strange nature of light. \n",
    "\n",
    "Individual packets of light do not have significant amounts of energy, leading to very small numbers when those energies are expressed in units of Joules. Often, we use a smaller unit, the **electron-volt (eV)**, where $1 eV = 1.60218\\times10^{-19} J$. The quantity $hc=1240 \\, {\\rm eV nm}$ is a convenient one for quickly finding the energy of a photon when you know it's wavelength in nanometers.\n",

    "### Coding with scientific units\n",
